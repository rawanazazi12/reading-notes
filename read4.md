  **What Learned at HTML lecture:** 

 1. What is **HTML** which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language used to express the website structure.
 2. *Markup* means changing stuff from code to the actual screen.
 3. I've learned how to write **HTML** codes using openning and closing tags.
 4. I've learned many important tags used in HTML:

      - < html>< /html>
      - < head>< /head>
      - < body>< /body>
