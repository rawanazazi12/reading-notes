# What I've learned at Today's lecture ...
### Hello friend,

Let me tell you about my second lecture of software development course, I've started learning *102 code*, I was so motivated to start this course, Today's lecture was full of 
new beneficial informations, cause a new useful stuff was learned, feeling so happy to share it with you dude,

Since I know you are interested in learning about programming, so I will tell you about it to encourage you to get started the course.

I've learned many useful and beneficial new things about programming:

* I've learned how to create an account on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) which is used to create and share projects online and to have HTML, CSS, JS files online by creating **repositories** where 
  you can create your codes and share them to public.
* I've learned a new language which is easer than HTML and takes less time and effort. 
    [***Markdown Language***](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax) used to write notes about the projects on GitHub page.
     * I've learned how to write codes using Markdown language.
     * I've learned how to write a link and image code.
     * I've learned how to use Markdown to format text.
* I've created my first repo on GitHub using Markdown language to talk breifly about Growth Mindset concept.
* I've learned a new thing about Markup which means change stuff from code to the actual screen (web page).

**Hope** you are encouraged now to learn more about programming and I am here for any help and support.
