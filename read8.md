# What I've Learned at JS Functions Lecture ...

  **What Learned at JS Functions lecture:**

*JavaScript Functions*:

  - A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

  - A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

*JavaScript Function Syntax*:  
   function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}

*Why Functions?*  
  - You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
  - You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.


*Function Invocation*  
The code inside the function will execute when "something" **invokes** (calls) the function:
  - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button).
  - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.
  - Automatically (self invoked).

*Function Return*  
  - When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.  
  - If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

*Local Variables*:  
  - Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become **LOCAL** to the function.
 - Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
