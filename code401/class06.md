## OOP

1. Stands for object-oriented programming.

2. What Is an Object?                
  An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. 

3. What Is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 

4. What Is Inheritance?                
Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software. 

5. What Is an Interface?          
An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. 

6. What Is a Package?
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. 

### Interfaces in Java                   
In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
 
### What Is Inheritance?                
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. In this example, Bicycle now becomes the superclass of MountainBike, RoadBike, and TandemBike. In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.
