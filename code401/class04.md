# What I've Learned at the 4th lecture of 401 code...

## OOP

1. Stands for object-oriented programming.

2. What Is an Object?                
  An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life. 

3. What Is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 

4. What Is Inheritance?                
Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software. 

5. What Is an Interface?          
An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. 

6. What Is a Package?
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. 

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

1. Decimals

Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which.

2. Bases        
The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 .

3. Counting with Different Number Systems

But you don't have to use 10 as a "Base". You could use 2 ("Binary"), 16 ("Hexadecimal"), or any number you want to!

4. Binary Numbers             
Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.

5. Hexadecimal Numbers     
They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
