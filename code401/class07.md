## Don’t Repeat Yourself 

1. DRY:
  is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

2. The **DRY** principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer.

3. **WET** 
  Violations of DRY are typically referred to as WET solutions, commonly taken to stand for "write everything twice" (alternatively "write every time", "we enjoy typing" or "waste everyone's time").

4. **AHA**
  Another approach to abstractions is the AHA principle. AHA stands for "Avoid Hasty Abstractions", described by Kent C. Dodds as optimizing for change first, and avoiding premature optimization.

5. **YAGNI** is a principle behind the XP practice of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW).It is meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous refactoring, continuous automated unit testing, and continuous integration.


## Minimum viable product

1. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.

2. A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more.

3. Developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customers—such as early adopters thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. 

4. **Purposes**

   * Be able to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources
   * Accelerate learning
   * Reduce wasted engineering hours
   * Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
   * Base for other products
