# Read: Class 43 - OSS Contributions

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

- It can be hard to imagine that many of the applications and programs we use today are built by hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people all over the world. Open-source software (OSS) is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individuals and businesses who use it, as well as to its programmers.


- For many outside of the IT world, the concept of contributing to open-source software seems like a remarkable psychological phenomenon, as many of the contributors do it by their own free will and are quite often unpaid for it.


- While each person may have different individual motivations, here is a list of some of the most common reasons why developers contribute to open-source software:

   1. Improve Coding Skills : 
     As with almost all professionals, the only way to truly learn and perfect your craft is to practice, practice, practice.

   2. Gain Early Experience : 
     Another motivation that is closely related to the first point is that OSS provides young developers with useful and valuable experience often required by companies for employment, even for internships and entry-level positions.


   3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition :
    Most people who are passionate about something strive to be recognized for the quality work they produce, and for some, developing software is a huge passion.

    4. Greater Job Prospects : 
     In the same way contributing to OSS can help you increase your chances of landing an internship, it can also improve your job and career prospects.


    5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level : 
     A lot of the time, developers first come across OSS as users. In this case, the desire to contribute to this particular piece of OSS stems from wanting to improve it for their own use â€“ either by improving certain areas or by developing new features and functionalities.
