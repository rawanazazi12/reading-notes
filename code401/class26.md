# Android Monetization


## Sell goods or services through your app                       
When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.


### Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

- Virtual game products, such as coins, gems, extra lives or turns, special items or equipment, characters or avatars, additional levels or playtime.
- App functionality or content, such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free version.
- Subscription services, such as streaming media, digital publications, and social networking services.
- Cloud software products, including data storage services, business productivity software, and financial management software.

## Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy

- Research other apps in your category: Learn how other developers charge for their apps and content. Consider whether there are benefits to offering users alternative ways to pay.
- Think about how your app will be used: Your app's usage patterns can indicate the best monetization choices. For apps with more casual usage, advertising and in-app purchases might be appropriate options. However, always consider offering an in-app purchase that removes ads.
- Make use of natural extensions: If your app can be extended or expanded, such as with adding levels in a game, consider making the core app available for free and offering extended features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.
- Consider your cost structures: If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions. Use a free trial period to encourage uptake.
- Consider your audience: For some audiences, the scope for using advertising, subscriptions, or in-app purchases can be limited. For example, users are more likely to pay for an ad-free, kid-friendly app than a casual use app. In these cases, premium (paid) apps are more appropriate.
- Consider local factors when setting prices: When setting prices for apps, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in specific markets, be sure to consider cost of living differences, local pricing patterns, pricing of competitive apps, and other market factors.
