## Linked Lists

1. What is a Linked List 
  A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

2. Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

3. Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

4. Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

5. Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

6. Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

7. Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency                  

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

  1. Running Time : The amount of time a function needs to complete.

  2. Memory Space : The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.
