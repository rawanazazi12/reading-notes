# What I've Learned at the 8th lecture of 201 code

## CSS Layout

1. `< div >` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

2. *Browsers* display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

3. The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

4. Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

5. A forward slash will return the homepage for the entire site, and a forward slash followed by a file name will return that file providing it is in the root directory.

6. Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

7. **Grids** help create professional and flexible designs.

8. *CSS* Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

9. You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

10. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

11. **Building Blocks** :CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

     - *Block-level elements* : start on a new line. Ex: < h1 >, < p >, < ul >, < li >


     - *Inline elements* : flow in between surrounding text. Ex: < img >, < b >, < i >


12. Controlling the Position of Elements: CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: **normal flow**, **relative positioning**, and **absolute positioning**. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

13. To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

14. *Normal Flow* : In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.

15. *Relative Positioning* : Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.


16. *Absolute Positioning* : When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal 
flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.

17. *Fixed Positioning* : Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property 
to have a value of fixed.
