# What I've Learned at the 9th lecture of 201 code

## Duckett HTML

1. **Forms** : The best known form on the web is probably 
the search box that sits right in the middle of 
Google's homepage.

2. **Form Controls** :There are several types of form controls that 
you can use to collect information from visitors 
to your site.
3. *How Forms Work* : A user fills in a form and then presses a button 
to submit the information to the server.

4. Whenever you want to collect information from 
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a 
`< form >` element.

5. Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

6. Each form control is given a name, and the text the 
user types in or the values of the options they select 
are sent to the server.

7. HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it 
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

8. In addition to the CSS properties covered in other 
chapters which work with the contents of all elements, 
there are several others that are specifically used to 
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

9. List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.

10. Table cells can have different borders and spacing in 
different browsers, but there are properties you can 
use to control them and make them more consistent.

11. Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.

12. Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more 
interactive.

## Duckett JS book

13. **Events** are the browser's way of indicating when 
something has happened (such as when a page has 
finished loading or a button has been clicked). 

14. *Binding* is the process of stating which event you are 
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting 
for that event to happen upon. 

15. When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a 
JavaScript function. When this function then changes 
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because 
it has responded to the user.

16. You can use event delegation to monitor for events 
that happen on all of the children of an element. 

17. The most commonly used events are W3C DOM 
events, although there are others in the HTMLS 
specification as well as browser-specific events.
