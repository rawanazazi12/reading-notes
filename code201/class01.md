# What I've Learned at the 1st lecture of 201 code...

## What I've learned from the Duckett HTML book:

1. How to access the web.  
  There are such a different ways to access a web:
   - *Browsers*:  People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.    
   - *Web Servers*:When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.  
   Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them. 
   - *Screen Readers* :Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.  
   - *Devices*:People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. 

2. How to create a [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website):  
>All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

3. How the website works:
>When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

4. How to describe the structure of the website:
using HTML codes to describe the structure of the website.
5. HTML uses elements or tags to describe the structure of the page such as: <p></p> , <head></head>, <body></body>.

6. How to create a web page on a PC.

7. The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version you are using: DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
8. How to add comments to your code: You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
9. Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element, including the class and id attributes: The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.   
10. The<div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
11. The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
12. Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
13. The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
14. The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
15. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5nelements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
16. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
17. It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
18. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
19. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
20. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
21. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


## What I've learned from the Duckett JS book:

1. **What is a script**: A script is  a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
2. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
3. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
4. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.
5. **What are Events**: programs are designed to do different things when users interact with the computer in different ways. For example, clicking on a contact link on a web page could bring up a contact form, and entering text into a search box may automatically trigger the search functionality. 
6. **What does an event do**: Programmers choose which event s they respond to. When a specific event happens, that event can be used to trigger a specific section of the code.
7. Computers create models of the world using data.
8. Programmers can write code to say when this event occurs, run that code.
9. Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page.
10. To make web page interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
11. How HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT fit together.
12. How to write a script for a web page:
 - It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
 - The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
 - If you view the source code of the page in  the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
