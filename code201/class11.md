## Duckett HTML book

### Chapter 16: "Images" (pp.406-427)

1. Controlling sizes of images in CSS: You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

2. You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.

3. Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

4. You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

5. Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

6. You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.

7. To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

### Chapter 19: "Practical Information" (476-492)

1. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** : SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.

2. Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.

3. Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.

4. To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.

5. **FTP** programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.

6. Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website 
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).


### Video and Audio APIs

1. >HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — `<video>` and `<audio>` — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. This article shows you how to do common tasks such as creating custom playback controls.

2. The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages.

3. The time display currently breaks if the video is an hour long or more (well, it won't display hours; just minutes and seconds).

4. Because `<audio>` elements have the same HTMLMediaElement functionality available to them, you could easily get this player to work for an `<audio>` element too.
