# What I've Learned at Loops in JavaScript Lecture ...

  **What Learned at Loops in JS lecture:**

1. *Bitwise operators*:
   A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001. 
   
2. *Logical operators*:
   Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.
    - AND :(&&) the condition is only true when both of them are true.
    - OR :(||) the condition is only false, when both are false.
3. *Loops*:  
  Loops is away to repeat code for an amount of time without copying and pasting the same code you want to run.
    - *For Loop* : when you want to repeat the code for limited amount of times until it false.  
      **For statement**: for(initialization; condition;update){the code that will keep running as long as the condition is true}.
  
    - *While Loop* : when you want to repeat the code for an unlimited amount of times until the condition is false.
     **While statement**: while(condition){while the condition is true keep running this code, if it's false break the loop}.
