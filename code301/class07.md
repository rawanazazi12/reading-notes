# What I've Learned at the 7th lecture of 301 code...

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

   A smart guy, he helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?     
    -  That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most -  important  breakthroughs in the history of computing.

    - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

    -  HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

3. What does a GET do?

   GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

4. What does a POST do?                         
   POST is a request method supported by HTTP used by the World Wide Web. By design, the POST request method requests that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message.

5. What does PUT do?            
   The PUT method is most often used to update an existing resource.

6. What does PATCH do?                
   The PATCH request method is used to partially modify a resource on the server.
