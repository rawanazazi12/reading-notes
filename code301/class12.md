## nosql vs sql


| SQL      |   NoSQL  |
| ----------- | ------------|
| databases are table based databases  |databases are document based, key-value pairs       |
|databases have predefined schema   |  databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data       |
| databases are vertically scalable  |  databases are horizontally scalable      |
|databases are good fit for the complex query  |  not good fit for complex queries      |
| databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications  |  you can use NoSQL for transactions purpose       |


1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
   structured query language        

2. Give a real world example:
   Oracle    

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?          
   NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

4. Give a real world example:       
   MongoDB 

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
   NoSQL database 

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    SQL databases

7. What does SQL stand for?          
   Structured Query Language

8. What is a realational database?           
   A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

9. What type of structure does a relational database work with?            
   Logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes.

10. What is a ‘schema’?             
    A database schema is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database.

11. What is a NoSQL database?          
    NoSQL databases ("not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.

12. What is inside of a Mongo database?
    MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections.

13. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.             
    MongoDB is more flexible cause it ensures high and diverse data availability.

14. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?                       
    NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).

 
## Things I want to know more about
   I want to learn more about MongoDB usage.
