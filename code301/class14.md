## When Women Stopped Coding

### What Happened To Women In Computer Science?

1. Modern computer science is dominated by men. But it hasn't always been this way.

2. A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for   decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.


3. What happened?

   We spent the past few weeks trying to answer this question, and there's no clear, single answer.

   But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

4. >In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon   University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.

5. >This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.


## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.

2. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
   When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. 

3. Diverse companies perform better

   Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. 
    
4. Companies are losing out on great talent              
   Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent. 

5. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
