##  Pair Programming

1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**                  
    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness
 
2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
