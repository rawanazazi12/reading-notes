# What I've learned at The Second Lecture of 102 code ...
** Hello again, friend**

Hope your are doing well, Today's lectute was pretty full of information but it worth it, I will tell you what I learned 

 ### Terminal
1. **CLI** : Normal command Line Interface 
2. **GUI** : Graphical user interface.
3. I've learned some commands using while writing on **CLI**  
4. I've learned to work on a new application which very useful any easy to learn:  
     - **Git**: used to allow you to work on your machine locally 
   so you can keep one copy of your work with multiple versions which called **VCS** which stands for *version control system*.


5. I also learned how to import a repo from GitHub to replit and how to puch it back again to GitHib using **ACP** which stands for:   
  *Add*

  *Commit* 

  *Push*

  Using these **commands** :
   
    + git add **.**
    + git commit -m"why"
    + git push origin main      
  
  
  *Other important commands have been learned used while working on **CLI** :* 
    * pwd : print working directory.
    * ls : list to show the files inside the file where you are inside, but not the hidden files.
    * ls-la : list all to show everything even the hidden files 
    * mkdir : create new folder.
    * cd : move inside the folder.
    * touch : to make a new file inside the directory I'm in.
   * cd **..** : move back to the parent directory.
